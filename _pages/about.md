<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Yakun Zhu (朱亚琨)**, a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at **Tongji University** (Shanghai, China). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Spatial Intelligence**, **3D/4D Vision**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am particularly enthusiastic about empowering agents with the ability to understand and reason about dynamic 4D environments. 

Currently, I am focusing on **4D spatio-temporal scene understanding**, aiming to leverage video data for metric 3D reconstruction and structured scene graph generation to support language-based reasoning and planning.

I am actively looking for **Ph.D. / Research Intern positions**. Please feel free to reach out to me via email.
